# Denoting Unknown Variables As Temporary Values

Throughout mathematics, formulae that expect data you may not have can be a roadblock in the calculation process. Many mathematicians have expressed temporary values for data that is to be substituted later in many different ways; it is a very common practice throughout the history of the discipline to utilise either a unique but documented method for expressions, or a more widely used one. Though I propose a more unified approach, to which clearly states what shall be used in it’s place. Here is the template of the notation:

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>[</mi>
  <mi>x</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>-></mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>&#953;</mi>
  <mi>]</mi>
</math>


To which  is unknown, and  is what shall be used in it’s place temporarily. Here is an example of it in use:



 is never given a value, but , which means  in that case is also , allowing for it to be given a temporary answer of , ready for  to be given a definite value.

 still exists in the equation, it is where the notation is denoted, it is not a rule for everything else in the equation, only for that specific variable.
