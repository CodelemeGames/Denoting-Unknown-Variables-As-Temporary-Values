# Denoting Unknown Variables As Temporary Values

Throughout mathematics, formulae that expect data you may not have can be a roadblock in the calculation process. Many mathematicians have expressed temporary values for data that is to be substituted later in many different ways; it is a very common practice throughout the history of the discipline to utilise either a unique but documented method for expressions, or a more widely used expression. Though I propose a more unified approach, to which clearly states what shall be used in it’s place. Here is the template of the notation:

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>[</mi>
  <mi>x</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>-></mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>&#953;</mi>
  <mi>]</mi>
</math>

To which <mi>x</mi> is unknown, and <mi>&#953;</mi> is what shall be used in it’s place temporarily. Here is an example of it in use:

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>[</mi>
  <mi>x</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>-></mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>2</mi>
  <mi>]</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>*</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>4</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>=</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>(2  *  4)</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>=</mi>
  <mspace width="1ex"></mspace>
  <mi>8</mi>
</math>


<mi>x</mi> is never given a value, but <mi>&#953; = 2</mi>, which means <mi>x</mi> in that case is also <mi>2</mi>, allowing for the equation to be given a temporary answer of <mi>8</mi>, ready for <mi>x</mi> to be given a definite value.

<mi>x</mi> still exists in the equation, it is where the notation is denoted, it is not a rule for anything else in the equation, only for that specific variable.

You can also use the notation outside of an equation, and state that it is in use for this instance. Here is an example:

[x -> 2] and [v -> 5] <br>
f(x) = x^2 * v <br>
f(2) = 2^2 * 5 <br>
f(2) = 20 <br>

Thank you for your time and consideration
